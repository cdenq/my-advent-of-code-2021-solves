## About My Advent of Code 2021

`My Advent of Code 2021' is a collection of code submissions to the Advent of Code 2021 (https://adventofcode.com/) event. I also documented my brainstorming, strategizing, and optimization processess as they happened in real-time during every challenge.

Like for every coding challenge, **I only use native Python for the extra challenge**.

I also exported every answer to a .csv file called `submission_answers.csv` for anyone that wants to quickly compare.
