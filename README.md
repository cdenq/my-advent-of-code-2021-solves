## About My Advent of Code 2021

`My Advent of Code 2021` is a collection of code submissions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) event. I also documented my brainstorming, strategizing, and optimization processess as they happened in real-time during every challenge. Like for every coding challenge, **I only use native Python**.

I also exported every answer to a .csv file called [`submission_answers.csv`](https://github.com/cdenq/my-advent-of-code-2021-solves/blob/main/submission_answers.csv) for anyone that wants to quickly compare answers.
